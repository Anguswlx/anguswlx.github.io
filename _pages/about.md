<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Lingxiao Wang(王 凌霄), now a  <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/members/lingxiao-wang'>Research Scientist(PI) in RIKEN-iTHEMS</a> (理化学研究所 数理創造プログラム). My research interest includes Machine Learning in Physics (especially high energy nuclear physics, e.g., QCD Matter, Lattice QCD, etc.), Medical AI and Human Behavior. See my latest <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFt4x3EYlrv9-_7SWEHKwdshggN2yv-A/view?usp=sharing'>CV</a> here.

Now, I'm running a working group of <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/about/working-groups/deep-in-wg'>"DEEP-IN" in RIKEN-iTHEMS</a>, which aims to develop deep learning models for inverse problems in physical sciences.

I have organized many "machine learning physics" seminars for physicists online, find the previous activities in our page <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/deep-in-wg/achieve'>MLP club</a>. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me via lwang[at]fias.uni-frankfurt.de.
